The `{rSharp}` R package provides access to `.NET` libraries from R. It allows
to create `.NET` objects, access their fields, and call their methods.

This package is based on the [rClr](https://github.com/rdotnet/rClr) package and
utilizes some of its code base.

## Important notes

As `{rSharp}` is provided with precompiled binary files, it is currently a 
[binary](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Building-binary-packages-1) package.

The package utilizes two code bases - the R code which is exposed to the user, 
and the C++/C# code that communicates with the .NET libraries. The end user of 
the package will only interact with the R code, and pre-build C++/C# libraries are
supplied with the package. See section [Installation](#installation) 
for instructions on how to install the package.

Advanced users and C++/C# developers might want to build the C++/C# code from source.
For this, follow the instructions in section [Build](#build).

## Installation 

### Windows

#### Prerequisites

- Latest Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019 available [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) 
- .NET 8 runtime available [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0/runtime).

#### Install from Github

You can install the package from GitHub with pre-build binaries by running:

```r
install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("Open-Systems-Pharmacology/rSharp@*release")
```

Get the latest development version with:

```r
pak::pak("Open-Systems-Pharmacology/rSharp")
```

#### Install from Binary

Alternatively, download the attached binary file (`.zip`) from [latest release](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/rSharp/releases), and install it locally using:

```r
install.packages("path/to/rSharp_X.zip",  type = "win.binary")
```

### MacOS

#### Prerequisites

- .NET 8 runtime available [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0/runtime) (click on the macOS tab).

#### Install from Github

You can install the package from GitHub with pre-build binaries by running:

```r
install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("Open-Systems-Pharmacology/rSharp@*release")
```

Get the latest development version with:

```r
pak::pak("Open-Systems-Pharmacology/rSharp")
```

#### Install from Binary

Alternatively, download the attached binary file (`.tgz`) from [latest release](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/rSharp/releases), and install it locally using:

```r
install.packages("path/to/rSharp_X.tgz")
```

### Ubuntu

#### Prerequisites

Run the following commands to install the required dependencies:

```
sudo apt-get install dotnet-runtime-8.0 libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev libxml2-dev 
sudo apt-get install libfontconfig1-dev libharfbuzz-dev libfribidi-dev
sudo apt-get install libfreetype6-dev libpng-dev libtiff5-dev libjpeg-dev
```

#### Install from Github

You can install the package from GitHub with pre-build binaries by running:

```r
install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("Open-Systems-Pharmacology/rSharp@*release")
```

Get the latest development version with:

```r
pak::pak("Open-Systems-Pharmacology/rSharp")
```

#### Install from Binary

Alternatively, download the attached binary file (`.tar.gz`) from [latest release](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/rSharp/releases), and install it locally using:

```r
install.packages("path/to/rSharp_X.tar.gz")
```

## Build

### Windows

To build the C++/C# libraries from source, make sure the ```Desktop development with C++``` workload is installed in Visual Studio.

Create an environment variable ```R_INSTALL_PATH``` and set the value to the path where R is installed

```
set R_INSTALL_PATH = "C:\Program Files\R\R-4.3.3"
```

Start Visual Studio and open the ```rSharp.sln``` solution file and build the solution.
The build process will automatically copy the required files to the `rSharp/inst/lib` folder.

Then start your preferred R environment and run the following R commands from within the ```rSharp``` folder

```
devtools::install()
```



### Ubuntu

Set up .NET SDK and `nuget` (the latter to get the required dependencies)

Optionally set up to build the binaries
```
sudo apt-get install dotnet-sdk-8.0
sudo apt-get install nuget
```

Navigate to the ```rSharp\shared``` directory and run
```
make
```

Then change back to the ```rSharp``` directory start your preferred R environment and run the following R commands
```
devtools::install()
```

### MacOS

Download and install [.NET SDK 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)

Install Homebrew and use it to install build tools

```
brew install nuget
brew install cmake
brew install gcc
```

Navigate to the ```rSharp\shared``` directory and run
```
make
```

Then change back to the ```rSharp``` directory start your preferred R environment and run the following R commands
```
devtools::install()
```
