This article is a knowledge base for the`{rSharp}` package. It is a collection of 
useful information that may help troubleshooting and understanding the package.

## Data type conversion

- `NA` is a concept of marking "missing values" in R which is not available in .NET.
What might appear conterintuitive is that `NA` has a type "logical" and is interpreted as 
`TRUE` when sent to .NET. Attention should be payed when sending `NA` to .NET methods.
- If the signature of a .NET method require an integer argument, it must be passed as an integer using `as.integer()` from R. R assumes all numerics as doubles by default, and will cause an error if passed to a method that expects an integer.
- Objects in R are vectors, and single values are just a particular case of vectors 
of length one. In the .NET, scalar values and arrays are different types.  In current implementation, 
an R vector with length >1 will be translated to an array in the .NET, a length 
of one becomes a scalar value. This might lead to problems when calling .NET methods
expecting a an array when passing a vector of 1.
