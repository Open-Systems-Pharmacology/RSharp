The `{rSharp}` package is a low-level interoperability bridge between R and 
the .NET runtime. It offers access to .NET libraries from R, allowing to create .NET objects, access their fields, and call their methods.

`{rSharp}` uses R's native interface to C++ which then calls the .NET runtime. To make working with .NET objects intuitive, `{rSharp}` utilizes the R6 object-oriented approach. This article
will guide you through the basic usage of the package, starting from loading an assembly to calling methods and accessing fields.

## Loading an assembly

To start working with a .NET assembly, you need to load it into the R session. This is done using the `rSharp::loadAssembly` function.

```r
